          If someone as severely burned or had a genetic blood condition,
          imagine if doctors could replace the damaged skin or blood cells with
          fresh ones. This is the potential of stem cells! Scientists all across
          the world are researching stem cells to figure out how they work and
          how they may be utilized to mend bodies and heal diseases.

              All cells in your body began as stem cells. As a stem cell
              matures, it differentiates or develops into a specialized cell
              with a defined purpose. So a stem cell can develop into a red
              blood cell that transports oxygen, a brain cell that transmits
              information throughout your body, a skin cell that shields your
              body, and so on.

              An embryonic stem cell is the most useful type of stem cell for
              scientists' research. This is because this sort of stem cell has
              the ability to differentiate into a wide variety of cells.
              However, embryonic stem cells are difficult to obtain.

              In 2012, Dr. Shinya Yamanaka and his colleagues made a significant
              discovery. They discovered how to induce, or turn, a
              differentiated cell from an adult human back into a stem cell. Dr.
              Yamanaka dubbed them "induced pluripotent stem cell," or iPS. They
              then developed this stem cell into a whole other type of
              differentiated cell! Scientists all throughout the world can now
              conduct research using these new types of stem cells. They seek to
              understand more about stem cells and how they may be employed to
              heal the body and treat diseases.

                  Human life begins with a fertilized egg. That egg divides,
                  then divides again, resulting in additional cells. The
                  embryo's cells start off as totipotent stem cells. Some of
                  these cells mature into the placenta, which provides
                  nourishment to the developing embryo. Others become the embryo
                  itself.

                  The growing embryo sends chemical signals instructing its
                  pluripotent stem cells to differentiate into one of three germ
                  layers: ectoderm, mesoderm, or endoderm. These layers consist
                  of multipotent stem cells. They can still differentiate into
                  other types of cells, but only within their germ layer.

                  As the embryo matures into a fetus and ultimately a baby, the
                  cells in the three germ layers develop into various organs and
                  tissues in the body. A differentiated cell is a specialized
                  cell that performs a specific job, such as a neuron or skin
                  cell (ectoderm layer), lung and pancreatic cells (endoderm
                  layer), and heart muscle and red blood cells (mesoderm layer).

                  In the lab, scientists can convert regular adult
                  differentiated cells back into a novel type of stem cell. They
                  are known as induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS). Scientists
                  can then use the same procedure to transform an iPS into an
                  entirely different type of cell: the iPS sorts into one of
                  three germ layers before differentiating into a specialized
                  cell within that layer.
