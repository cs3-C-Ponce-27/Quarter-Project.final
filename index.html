                <p>
                    Stem cells are being studied to treat type 1 diabetes, Parkinson's
                    disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, heart failure,
                    osteoarthritis and other conditions. Stem cells may have the
                    potential to be grown to become new tissue for use in transplant and
                    regenerative medicine.

                    You've heard about stem cells in the news and wondered if they could
                    help you or a loved one with a terrible illness. Here are some
                    responses to frequently asked stem cell queries.

                <h2>What are stem cells?</h2>
                <p>
                    Stem cells are a special type of cells that have two important
                    properties. They are able to make more cells like themselves. That is,
                    they self-renew. And they can become other cells that do different
                    things in a process known as differentiation. Stem cells are found in
                    almost all tissues of the body. And they are needed for the
                    maintenance of tissue as well as for repair after injury.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Depending on where the stem cells are, they can differentiate into
                    various tissues. For example, hematopoietic stem cells live in the
                    bone marrow and can create all blood cells. Stem cells can also
                    differentiate into brain, heart muscle, bone, and other types of
                    cells.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are different types of stem cells. Embryonic stem cells are the
                    most adaptable because they can give rise to all of the fetus's cells.
                    The bulk of stem cells in the body have little ability to produce
                    cells and may only help maintain and repair the tissues and organs in
                    which they exist.
                </p>
                <p>
                    No other cell in the body has the intrinsic potential to form new cell
                    types.

            <h2>Why is there such an interest in stem cells?</h2>
            <p>Researchers are studying stem cells to see if they can help to:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Increase understanding of how diseases occur. By watching stem cells
                    mature into cells in bones, heart muscle, nerves, and other organs
                    and tissue, researchers may better understand how diseases and
                    conditions develop.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Generate healthy cells to replace cells affected by disease
                    (regenerative medicine). Stem cells can be guided into becoming
                    specific cells that can be used in people to regenerate and repair
                    tissues that have been damaged or affected by disease.
                </li>
            </ul>

                Stem cells may have the potential to be grown to become new tissue for
                use in transplant and regenerative medicine. Researchers continue to
                advance the knowledge on stem cells and their applications in
                transplant and regenerative medicine.

                <p>
                    These stem cells are found in small numbers in most adult tissues,
                    such as bone marrow or fat. Compared with embryonic stem cells,
                    adult stem cells have a more limited ability to give rise to various
                    cells of the body.

                    Scientists have transformed regular adult cells into stem cells
                    using genetic reprogramming. By altering the genes in the adult
                    cells, researchers can make the cells act similarly to embryonic
                    stem cells. These cells are called induced pluripotent stem cells
                    (iPSCs).

                <p>
                    Researchers have discovered stem cells in amniotic fluid as well as
                    umbilical cord blood. These stem cells can change into specialized
                    cells.
